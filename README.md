# Runaway
A 2D platformer, made by using my knowledge gained at http://www.learncpp.com/ and the documentation of SFML.

> If you want to play the game, download this repository and and run the Runaway.exe in the **Game** folder. To build the game yourself, be sure to build it in 32 bit because the version of SFML is 32 bit. 

# Purpose
I was originally planning to finish the book Game Engine Architecture http://www.gameenginebook.com/ first before I started another project.
But I was intrested in how far this book would help me with my skills. So I decided to challenge myself. By building a game from scratch,
I'll keep a log book in which I will describe my progress of thinking. After I've finished this project, I'll finish the book,
make an alike or better game, which will hopefully show me how my way of thinking has changed.  
Of course, this all seems a bit unnecessary, but I think it's rather fun. I do enjoy programming, so why not challenge myself. 
It will also show me my weaker spots which is always a good thing. And that concludes the purpose of this program.

# Sources
I've learned C++ at http://www.learncpp.com/ and http://www.cplusplus.com/doc/tutorial/  
SFML can be found at https://www.sfml-dev.org/index.php  
My choice of IDE was Visual Studio which can be found at https://www.visualstudio.com/vs/  
The levels were made with an open source tile map editor called Tiled found at http://www.mapeditor.org/  
I used the parser RapidXML, which can be found at http://rapidxml.sourceforge.net/ to parse the tilemap made by Tiled
